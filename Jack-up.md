# Jack AI Assistant - Advanced Upgrades Roadmap

This document outlines potential advanced features and upgrades for Jack, the AI assistant integrated into TaskZenith. The goal is to make Jack an even more indispensable tool for productivity and task management.

## 1. Enhanced Proactive Task Management

*   **Smart Scheduling & Deadline Management:**
    *   Jack could analyze task priorities, estimated durations, and user's calendar (if integrated) to suggest optimal work schedules.
    *   Proactively warn about upcoming deadlines or potential conflicts.
    *   Suggest rescheduling tasks based on workload and new priorities.
*   **Dependency-Aware Assistance:**
    *   If a task Jack is aware of is blocked by another, Jack could notify the relevant user or suggest follow-ups.
    *   When a prerequisite task is completed, Jack could prompt the user to start the dependent task.
*   **Resource Allocation Suggestions (Team Context):**
    *   If TaskZenith supports team features, Jack could analyze team member workloads and skills to suggest optimal task assignments.
*   **Automated Task Breakdown:**
    *   Users describe a large goal, and Jack breaks it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks with suggested priorities and deadlines.
    *   Leverage existing "Smart Task Creation" but with more granularity and direct creation into the board.

## 2. Deeper Contextual Understanding & Personalized Memory

*   **Persistent User Preferences & Work Styles:**
    *   Jack learns individual user habits (e.g., preferred work times, common project types, preferred communication style for reminders).
    *   Allows users to explicitly tell Jack their preferences (e.g., "Jack, remind me about high-priority tasks at 9 AM daily").
*   **Project-Specific Knowledge Base:**
    *   Jack could build a knowledge base from task descriptions, comments, and attached documents within a specific project or board.
    *   Answer questions like "What was the decision on X feature for Project Y?" by searching project context.
*   **Cross-Board/Cross-Project Awareness:**
    *   Ability to search or summarize information across multiple boards if the user has access.
    *   "Jack, show me all high-priority tasks related to 'client X' across all my projects."
*   **Summarization of Task/Project Progress:**
    *   "Jack, give me a summary of what happened on 'Project Phoenix' this week."
    *   Generate brief progress reports based on task status changes, comments, and completions.

## 3. Advanced Natural Language & Interaction Capabilities

*   **Voice Commands & Dictation:**
    *   Allow users to interact with Jack and create/update tasks using voice.
*   **Natural Language Task Updates:**
    *   User: "Jack, mark 'Design UI' as complete and set 'Develop Backend' to high priority."
*   **Sentiment Analysis in Comments:**
    *   Jack could flag potential issues or frustrations in task comments for project managers. (Ethical considerations needed).
*   **Automated Meeting Summaries & Action Item Creation:**
    *   If integrated with calendar/meeting tools or provided with a transcript, Jack could summarize meetings and suggest creating tasks for action items.

## 4. Workflow Automation & Genkit Tool Expansion

*   **User-Defined AI Automations via Chat:**
    *   Users could instruct Jack to create simple automations: "Jack, whenever a task in 'To Do' is assigned to me and marked 'High Priority', send me an email."
    *   This would require Jack to interface with a more robust automation engine within TaskZenith, potentially using Genkit tools to define and trigger these automations.
*   **Integration with External Tools (via Genkit):**
    *   Connect Jack to other services (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack, GitHub) to fetch information or perform actions.
    *   "Jack, create a Google Calendar event for the 'Client Meeting' task."
    *   "Jack, post an update to the #project-alpha Slack channel when 'Feature X' is deployed."
*   **Custom Genkit Tools for Specific TaskZenith Actions:**
    *   Develop more Genkit tools that Jack can leverage for complex TaskZenith operations not covered by basic CRUD (e.g., "archive old completed tasks," "generate a burndown chart link for project X").

## 5. Data Insights & Reporting

*   **Productivity Insights:**
    *   "Jack, how many tasks did I complete last week compared to the week before?"
    *   "Jack, what's my average task completion time for 'bug fix' tasks?"
*   **Team Performance Overview (Team Context):**
    *   Provide anonymized or permissioned reports on team velocity, bottlenecks, and workload distribution.
*   **Predictive Analysis (Ambitious):**
    *   Based on historical data, Jack could offer predictions on project completion times or identify tasks at risk of delay.

## 6. Enhanced Collaboration Features (Team Context)

*   **Smart Notifications to Team Members:**
    *   Jack could intelligently notify relevant team members about task updates, comments, or dependencies without excessive noise.
    *   "Jack, let Sarah know I've finished the designs she was waiting for."
*   **Facilitating Stand-ups/Check-ins:**
    *   Jack could prompt team members for updates and compile them into a summary.

## 7. Learning & Self-Improvement

*   **Feedback Mechanism:**
    *   Allow users to rate Jack's responses or suggestions (thumbs up/down).
    *   Jack uses this feedback to refine its responses over time (requires a mechanism for model fine-tuning or preference learning).
*   **Adaptive Prompting based on Success Rates:**
    *   If certain phrasing or information structure consistently leads to better AI outcomes for specific flows (e.g., task creation, prioritization), Jack could subtly guide users or adapt its internal prompts.

These upgrades aim to transform Jack from a helpful assistant into a truly intelligent partner in task management, significantly boosting user productivity and providing valuable insights within TaskZenith.
